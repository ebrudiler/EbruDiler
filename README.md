## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am both a Master of Science student at [Dokuz Eylul University](https://global.deu.edu.tr/) and a Software QA Engineer at [Veripark](https://www.veripark.com).

I have developed the [Performance of Python programs](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/performance-of-python-programs-on-new-hpc-architectures/) project on [High Performance Computing](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/faq-about-hpc-prace/) at [EPCC](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/) in 2018. If you have any questions about the program, I would be happy to answer them. :wink:
